		    <p>When it comes to choosing a hospital, one thing is clear: quality counts. But name doesn't. So much so that we don't even <em>have</em> a name yet.  Nevertheless, with more than two decades of tradition, excellence and quality in providing medical care in a comfortable and convenient environment, we bring peace of mind for the patients we care about every day with the help of our surgeons, some other surgeons, and some more surgeons.</p>

		    <p>Even though we don't have a name, what we do have are patients, and surgeons. We focus on offering a... range of consistent high quality and up-to-date medical surgeries that will allow us to perform surgeries.  On our patients.  By our surgeons.  </p>

		    <p>As a healthcare organization, we might not have a name.  However, our patients and surgeons do.  And they are accessable through this portal.  So, create an account and join us at the Nameless Hospital™ Patient Registry!</p>
